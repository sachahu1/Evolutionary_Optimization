# Evolutionary Algorithm

This module can be used to solve optimization tasks.
For instance, you could use this module to tune the hyper-parameters of a neural
network or a decision tree.

## Getting started
### Installation
To install the package, simply run:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/sachahu1/Evolutionary_Optimization
cd Evolutionary_Algorithm
```
Then, set up a virtual environment like so:
```shell script
python3 -m venv ./venv
```
Activate your virtual environment:
```shell script
source venv/bin/activate
```
And install the dependencies:
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Using the package
First go to the right directory:
```shell script
cd Evolutionary_Algorithm/src
```
Then, run the code as follows:
```python
python3 train_ea.py
```
