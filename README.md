# Evolutionary Optimization

This module can be used to solve optimization tasks.
For instance, you could use this module to tune the hyper-parameters of a neural
network or a decision tree.

## Getting started
### Installation
To install the package, simply run:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/sachahu1/Evolutionary_Optimization
cd Evolutionary_Optimization
```
Then, set up a virtual environment like so:
```shell script
python3 -m venv ./venv
```
Activate your virtual environment:
```shell script
source venv/bin/activate
```
And install the dependencies:
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Using the package
First go to the right directory:
```shell script
cd Evolutionary_Optimization/src
```
Then, run the code as follows:
```python
python3 train_ea.py
```
### Configuring your experiment
You can easily configure your own optimization problem through the ```Evolutionary_Optimization/src/config.py``` file.
To do so, simply follow these steps:<br>
* Write your own test function which evaluates an individual's genotype into a phenotype (see ![these examples](Evolutionary_Optimization/src/test_functions.py)).
* Write your own fitness function which evaluates an individual's phenotype and returns a fitness score (see ![these examples](Evolutionary_Optimization/src/loss_functions.py)).
* Define your own genotype in the format of a python Dict with the minimum and maximum values
* Configure the parameters of your experiment

You're all set and ready to solve your optimization problem!

### Examples
Below are a few examples of an evolutionary optimization task being solved. In these examples, the black dot represents the best individual in the population and the cross represents the worst individual.
